Recipes for Soto vary across regions, with each version offering a distinct taste and story. With abundant Soto recipes available online, wouldn't it be exciting to scrape and analyze these recipes to uncover patterns and insights?\n","\n","In this notebook, we will explore how to scrape Soto recipes from Cookpad, a popular recipe-sharing platform, translate them into English, and extract structured information for further analysis. This step-by-step guide combines web scraping, data cleaning, and translation, making it an excellent learning resource for beginners and enthusiasts. This project is developed with the assistance of DeepSeek and ChatGPT.\n","\n","## Objectives\n","* **Scrape Recipes:** Collect Soto recipe data, including names, ingredient lists, and URLs, from Cookpad.\n","* **Extract Details:** Parse and structure the scraped information into a DataFrame.\n","* Translate Ingredients:** Use a translation API to translate Indonesian ingredient names into English.\n","* **Create a Dataset:** Save the processed data into a CSV file for easy sharing and future analysis.\n","\n","## Tools and Libraries\n","We will use the following Python libraries:\n","* **`requests`**: To fetch HTML content from web pages.\n","* **`BeautifulSoup`**: For parsing and extracting structured data from the HTML.\n","* **`pandas`**: To organize and manipulate data in tabular form.\n","* **`deep-translator`**: For translating text using Google Translate.\n","\n","Before running the code, make sure you have installed these
